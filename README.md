Enterprise UX Case Study – HR Performance Dashboard

This project is part of a 21-day focused journey to build MNC-ready UX case studies while working full-time (2 hours daily).

## 📅 Day 1 – Enterprise UX Research

### 🏢 What is Enterprise UX?
Enterprise UX refers to the design of software used for business environments where users complete data-heavy, repetitive, and task-driven work. These systems prioritize clarity, efficiency, and consistency over visual flair.

### 🔄 Enterprise UX vs Consumer UX

| Enterprise UX | Consumer UX |
|---------------|---------------|
| Task and workflow focused | Experience and delight focused |
| Supports complex data views | Simpler screens |
| Role-based workflows | Individual user journeys |
| Consistent information layout | Flexible interface designs |
| Efficiency and scalability | Emotional engagement |

### ⚠️ Key Challenges in Enterprise UX
From research and product observation:
- Handling complex workflows and multiple user roles
- Presenting high volumes of data clearly
- Ensuring consistency across modules
- Creating scalable design systems
- Balancing function with ease-of-use

### 📌 Observations from Real Products
**SAP Fiori**
- Modular dashboard pattern
- KPI cards and summary widgets
- Navigation with structured menus

**Zoho People**
- Extensive data tables
- Search-first interaction
- Neutral color palette and clear hierarchy

**IBM Carbon System**

### ♯ My Key Learnings (Day 1 Reflection)
- Enterprise UX is built around clarity and predictability.  
- Design systems are fundamental for scalable enterprise apps.  
- Navigation and data structure matter more than color trends.  
- Accessibility principles must be integrated from the beginning.

### 📌 What’s Next
Tomorrow (Day 2) I will:
- Define the HR Dashboard problem statement  
- Create user personas based on target user roles
